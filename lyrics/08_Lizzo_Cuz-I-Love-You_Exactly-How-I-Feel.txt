That's exactly how I feel
That's exactly how I feel
That's exactly how I feel
I woke up this morning
Wrong side of the bed
I don't have to 'splain it
(How I feel)
I might be a bitch (Bitch)
I might make a friend (Friend)
Ain't I so amazing? (Uh-huh)
Love me or hate me
Who are you changing?
And I don't give a fuck, no
That's exactly how I feel (Uh)
That's exactly how I feel (Say it again)
That's exactly how I feel (Woo)
Don't hide no emotions (Emotions)
Wear 'em on my sleeve (On my sleeve)
All my feelings Gucci
(It's Gucci)
Can't hold back my tears
That would be a crime
'Cause I look pretty cryin'
Oh, they ain't tell you?
Love me or hate me
Who are you changing?
And I don't give a fuck, no
That's exactly how I feel (How I feel)
That's exactly how I feel (How I feel)
(It's Gucci)
That's exactly how I feel
I feel like hurtin' they feelings
I don't get mad, I get millions
My heart ain't got no feelings
My cars ain't got no ceiling
I ain't with that actin' all friendly
Please step away from the Bentley
You're either not with me or with me
Defy close by like he's with me
Stay in your lane, don't tempt me
Mister bust a whole clip 'til it's empty
I got a feelin' that tonight's gonna be a good night
Like Ferg and them said, God willing
Fire chains on like brr
Feelin' like rockin' my fur
Rolls Royce with the chauffeur
How your toes feel on the mink floor?
It's Gucci
Cry 'cause I want to
Smile if I want to
Yes I can
Love 'cause I want to
Get so mad I could scream (I could scream)
I could scream (I could scream)
I could scream (Sing it)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
That's exactly how I feel (How I feel)
That's exactly how I feel (How I feel)
That's exactly how I feel
