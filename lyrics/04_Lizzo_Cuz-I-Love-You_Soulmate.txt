True story
No glory, let's go
Yeah, the old me used to love a Gemini
Like a threesome, fuckin' with him every night
A lotta two-faced people show me both sides
So I figured out I gotta be my own type
They used to say to get a man you had to know how to look
They used to say to keep a man you had to know how to cook
But I'm solo in Soho, sippin' Soju in Malibu
It's a me, myself kinda attitude
'Cause I'm my own soulmate (Yeah, yeah)
I know how to love me (Love me)
I know that I'm always gonna hold me down
Yeah, I'm my own soulmate (Yeah, yeah)
No, I'm never lonely (Lonely)
I know I'm a queen but I don't need no crown
Look up in the mirror like damn she the one
One, one, one, one, one, one (The one)
Like damn she the one
One, one, one (The one)
That bitch in the mirror like yeah, I'm in love
Love, love, love, love, love, love (In love)
Like yeah, I'm in love
Love, love, love (In love)
Look up in the mirror like damn she the one
And she never tell me to exercise
We always get extra fries
And you know the sex is fire
And I gotta testify
I get flowers every Sunday
I'mma marry me one day
True love ain't something you can buy yourself
True love finally happens when you by yourself
So if you by yourself, then go and buy yourself
Another round from the bottle on the higher shelf
'Cause I'm my own soulmate (Yeah, yeah)
I know how to love me (Love me)
I know that I'm always gonna hold me down 
(Always gonna hold me down)
Yeah, I'm my own soulmate (Yeah, yeah)
No, I'm never lonely (Lonely) 
(No I'm never lonely, no)
I know I'm a queen but I don't need no crown
Look up in the mirror like damn she the one
One, one, one, one, one, one (The one)
Like damn she the one (She the one, she the one)
One, one, one (The one) (She the one, she the one, she the one)
That bitch in the mirror like yeah, I'm in love
(I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love)
Love, love, love, love, love, love (In love)
(I'm in love, I'm in love)

Love, love, love (In love)
