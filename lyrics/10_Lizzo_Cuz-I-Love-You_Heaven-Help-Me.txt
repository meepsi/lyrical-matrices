Heaven help me
If love ain't dead I'ma kill it 'cause it's killin' me
Cold world, they'll be livin' in a fantasy
Got me, it's the only thing I'll ever need
Heaven help me
If love ain't dead I'ma kill it 'cause it's killin' me
Love is a drug with amphetamine
D-A-R-E, they'll be hooked on me
Y'all, who you think you sassing?
Say whoa, baby I'm a classic
Say whoa, silent like a Hitchcock
Say whoa, got you goin' psycho
Oh no, don't you get your Sheera
Say whoa, catch you with the tick tock
Say whoa, time's up on these motherfuckers
Say whoa, what you say, what you say sucker?
(Say whoa, what you say?)
If you think you got me dickmatized
(Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah)
I need to get you out of my life
Can I get an amen?
Heaven help me
If love ain't dead I'ma kill it 'cause it's killin' me
Cold world, they'll be livin' in a fantasy
Got me, it's the only thing I'll ever need
Heaven help me
If love ain't dead I'ma kill it 'cause it's killin' me
Love is a drug with amphetamine
D-A-R-E, they'll be hooked on me
Hit 'em with the Bible, say whoa
Hit 'em with the drive-by, say whoa
Hit 'em with the dry cry, say whoa
Then you get a new guy, hello
Even if you are the love of my life
Sorry baby, I got too much pride
Heaven help me
If love ain't dead I'ma kill it 'cause it's killin' me
Cold world, they'll be livin' in a fantasy
Got me, it's the only thing I'll ever need
Heaven help me
If love ain't dead I'ma kill it 'cause it's killin' me
Love is a drug with amphetamine
D-A-R-E, they'll be hooked on me
Heaven help me
If love ain't dead I'ma kill it 'cause it's killin' me
Oh, can I get an amen? (amen)
Been thinkin' about you, thinkin' about you, thinkin' about you baby
If love didn't drive me crazy, maybe I'd be your baby
Trust baby, you can't make me, there you go tryin' to change me
