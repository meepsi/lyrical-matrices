(Yeah)
Damn

Hair down, moonlit
Look at my lipstick
So thick, so fit
Wanna put your lips in places, oh
The sun don't shine there
I like that right there (I like that)
Keep goin' and goin' and keep it flowin', uh
You know what you doin', don't you?

So I lounge around in my lingerie
I wanna be prepared for you just in case
So I lounge around in my lingerie
You better come my way

I don't got no secrets
You don't know these panties are see-through
I'm exposed, yeah
Treat you with my body, my eyes closed
Baby let me feel you close
You make me crescendo, I'm going up
Oh, oh, oh
Yeah, let's open the window
And let the world know
Oh, oh, oh

So I lounge around in my lingerie
I wanna be prepared for you just in case
So I lounge around in my lingerie
You better come my way

So I lounge around in my lingerie
I wanna be prepared for you just in case, yeah
So I lounge around in my lingerie
Oh, you better come my way
