Uh
Go
Woke up feelin' like I just might run for President
Even if there ain't no precedent, switchin' up the messaging
I'm about to add a little estrogen
Buy my whip by myself
Pay my rent by myself
Only exes that I care about are in my fucking chromosomes
I don't really need you, I'm Macaulay Culkin home alone
Bad bitch, diamonds in my collarbone (yee, yee)
Buy my whip by myself
Pay my rent by myself
Sugar, spice and I'm nice
Show me what you're made of
Crazy, sexy, cool baby
With or without makeup
Got nothing to prove (got nothing to prove)
But I'ma show you how I do
Find me up in Magic City bustin' hundreds by the bands
And I throw it like a girl
Throw it, throw it like a girl
Hangin' out the 750
Feelin' bossy in my city
'Cause I run it like a girl
Run it, run it like a girl
I work my femininity
I make these boys get on their knees
Now watch me do it, watch me do it
Look it, look it, I'ma do it
Like a girl (like a girl)
Like a girl (like a girl)
Shoot the car through the fire, light the kerosene (we can do it)
Lauryn Hill told me everything is everything (we can do it)
Serena Willy showed me I can win the Wimbledon (we can do it)
Uh, put me on a pedestal
Bet on me, bet I will
Sugar, spice and I'm nice
Show me what you're made of
Crazy, sexy, cool baby
With or without makeup
Got nothing to prove (got nothing to prove)
But I'ma show you how I do (but I'ma show you how I do)
Find me up in Magic City bustin' hundreds by the bands
And I throw it like a girl
Throw it, throw it like a girl
Hangin' out the 750
Feelin' bossy in my city
'Cause I run it like a girl
Run it, run it like a girl
I work my femininity
I make these boys get on their knees
Now watch me do it, watch me do it
Look it, look it, I'ma do it
Like a girl (like a girl)
Like a girl (like a girl)
So if you fight like a girl, cry like a girl
Do your thing, run the whole damn world
If you feel like a girl then you real like a girl
Do your thing, run the whole damn world
If you fight like a girl, cry like a girl
Do your thing, run the whole damn world
If you feel like a girl then you real like a girl
Do your thing, run the whole damn world
Find me up in Magic City bustin' hundreds by the bands
And I throw it like a girl (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Throw it, throw it like a girl
Hangin' out the 750 (hangin' out the 750, baby)
Feelin' bossy in my city
'Cause I run it like a girl (yeah, I run it like a girl)
Run it, run it like a girl
I work my femininity (yeah, I work it baby)
I make these boys get on their knees (get on your knees, yeah)
Now watch me do it, watch me do it
Look it, look it, I'ma do it (watch me do it)
Like a girl (like a girl)
Like a girl (like a girl, yeah)
Shit, fuck, I didn't know it was ending right there
